\begin{abstract}
In recent years, CPU manufacturers have introduced additional operating modes to
their CPUs, in addition to privileged and unprivileged modes, like Intel SGX or
ARM Trustzone. These modes are all implemented in hardware and are therefore
need to be taken as is to the operating system and applications. This
development raises the question of whether it is possible to define such modes
in software and what challenges are associated with this approach.\par

One approach to this problem could be the introduction of an so called
"Mode-Switch-Mode". This approach envisions a single hardware-provided mode,
called the Mode-Switch Mode,responsible for transitioning between other modes.
Whenever a transition occurs, the CPU switches to the Mode-Switch Mode, which
configures the CPU to enter the desired mode.\par

In this presentation, I will explain the concept of this "Mode-Switch-Mode" in
detail and discuss some of the difficulties which occurred while trying to
implement it in the gem5 simulator.
